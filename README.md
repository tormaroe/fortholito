FORTHolito is

* A programming language
* .. specifically an implementation of the [FORTH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)) programming language
* .. implemented in Ruby
* .. because programming is fun

But it might become more! I'm planning an extension to the language making it a powerfull TDD environment promoting safe and bugfree software. Then I'll enter it into the [PLT Games: Testing the Waters](http://www.pltgames.com/competition/2013/1) competition.
